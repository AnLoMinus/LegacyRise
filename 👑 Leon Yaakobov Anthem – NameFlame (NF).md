### [VERSE 1]

Born in the shadows but I’m walking like a king,
Every scar on my story got a diamond in the ring,
Family on my back, hear the echo when I move,
Every step that I’m taking is a generational proof.

I don’t chase clout, I don’t beg for a mention,
I’m building foundations, not random attention,
From the block to the book, from the pain to the plan,
I’m writing new chapters with a mic in my hand.

All the cycles that were spinning, I’m about to cut ’em off,
No more rage, no more cages, no more hearts going soft,
Turn the trauma into power, all the doubt into flame,
When they ask me who I do it for, I’m pointing to the name.

YAAKOBOV on the banner, see it glowing in the storm,
Lightning in my veins while the blessings take form,
When I’m praying in the morning, when I’m grinding all night,
I’m aligning every move with the side of the Light.

---

### [HOOK]

Leon Yaakobov, crown in the sky so bright,
Hustle for the last name, grind through the darkest night,
Curse breaker bloodline, turning pressure into gold,
NameFlame forever, let the legacy unfold.

### [VERSE 2]

They said “history repeats,” I replied “not here,”
’Cause I’m cutting off the script that was written by fear,
I’m the glitch in the pattern, the break in the chain,
I’m the sun through the window in a house full of rain.

I invest in my mind, I invest in my soul,
I’m not dying with the music still locked in the vault,
Every talent that I carry is a seed for the tree,
And my children eat the fruit from the hustle they see.

No more curses in the language, only blessing when I speak,
Turn the hate into lessons, every loss into technique,
From the lows to the highs, I’m aware and awake,
I’m protecting this bloodline with each choice that I make.

When I walk through the city, I remember who I am,
Not a random in the crowd but a fully loaded plan,
With a purpose in my chest and the fire in my tone,
Say the last name first, then you add “Leon.”

---

### [HOOK]

Leon Yaakobov, crown in the sky so bright,
Hustle for the last name, grind through the darkest night,
Curse breaker bloodline, turning pressure into gold,
NameFlame forever, let the legacy unfold.

---

### [BRIDGE – MELODIC]

I’m not running from the story, I’m rewriting every line,
Turn the darkness into glory, let the generations shine,
Every heartbeat is a contract that I sign with the Above,
“For the Yaakobov forever” – written in eternal love.

---

### [HOOK – FINAL]

Leon Yaakobov, crown in the sky so bright,
Hustle for the last name, grind through the darkest night,
Curse breaker bloodline, turning pressure into gold,
NameFlame forever, let the legacy unfold.
