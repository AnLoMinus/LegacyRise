# 🌑 1. ROOT CHAKRA – MULADHARA

### **(Red • 396Hz • Stability • Grounding)**

### 🎤 **VERSE – Deep Extended**

Feet on the earth, I remember where I’m from —
barefoot on the soil, hearing ancient drums.
I return to the origin, to the root, to the sum —
my lineage whispers strength through the pulse I become.
Leon standing firm like a mountain in the drum —
a living monument carved by where I’m from.
Heartbeat synced with creation, ancient rhythm hum —
a sacred vibration that no darkness can overcome.
Every fear that I carried starts turning into stone —
solidifying, neutralizing, no longer my own.
It dissolves into dust when I claim my throne —
I plant myself deep, unshakable to the bone.
I break ancestral chains just by standing in my zone —
rewriting destiny with the power I’ve grown.
Presence is power, alignment is home —
I breathe into the core where strength is sown.

### **(Orange • 417Hz • Creativity • Flow)**

### 🎤 **VERSE – Deep Extended**

Water in my veins when the rhythm starts to move —
liquid intuition guiding every groove.
Flowing like a river that refuses to lose —
I surrender to the current life calls me to choose.
Sacred fire in my belly when I step into the groove —
a fusion of elements where passions improve.
Creation awakening, destiny approves —
every gesture and motion becomes a muse.
Creation in my DNA, passion in my stride —
my purpose coded in the essence inside.
Holy sparks of desire rise from inside —
dancing flames of potential I no longer hide.
Yaakobov flame painting galaxies inside —
visions expanding wide like cosmic tides.
I manifest reality with cosmic pride —
co-creating existence with the universe as my guide.

# 🟨 3. SOLAR PLEXUS – MANIPURA

### **(Yellow • 528Hz • Power • Purpose)**

### 🎤 **VERSE – Deep Extended**

I ignite solar winds when I speak with intent —
firestorms of purpose in every ascent.
Purpose so pure it was heaven‑sent —
crafted in realms where souls are meant.
Every doubt that I had becomes energy spent —
fueling the vision I’m here to present.
I recycle the fear into confidence bent —
alchemy of willpower in radiant descent.
I don’t bow to the system, I transform and ascend —
I rise like the sun when the shadows bend.
I’m not molded by pressure — I cause pressure to bend —
the universe shifts when my truth extends.
Every loss from my past becomes power I send —
the wounds become wisdom that others transcend.
Fuel for the mission, light I extend —
the golden core inside me refuses to end.

# 💚 4. HEART CHAKRA – ANAHATA

### **(Green • 639Hz • Love • Compassion)**

### 🎤 **VERSE – Deep Extended**

Heart open wide like a temple in the sky —
a sanctuary of truth where shadows go to die.
I become the altar where the wounds testify —
they soften and release when love passes by.
I forgive, I release, let the heavy lies die —
letting go of the burdens no longer apply.
Truth flows inward; illusions say goodbye —
my chest expands as new worlds amplify.
Love is the weapon and the healing I choose —
one that cuts but never bruises or reduces.
The softest force that can never lose —
it conquers where anger only confuses.
Even pain turns to wisdom when the Light breaks through —
the heart reveals meanings only the brave view.
Gold is formed from the fire that you walk into —
a transformation sacred and long overdue.

* 639Hz הוא תדר חיבור, אהבה, סליחה — ריפוי בין‑אישי.

# 🔷 5. THROAT CHAKRA – VISHUDDHA

### **(Blue • 741Hz • Truth • Expression)**

### 🎤 **VERSE – Deep Extended**

Words like lightning when I channel the truth —
thunderous clarity awakening youth.
Striking the core of the rising youth —
empowering voices searching for proof.
My voice carries codes for the ones breaking through —
a blueprint of courage for souls overdue.
Frequency sharp like a blade made new —
cutting illusions the world once drew.
I don’t whisper what I’m called to shout —
my speech casts shadows out.
I cast out doubt when I let truth out —
my tongue becomes a spiritual route.
I speak life into souls till the darkness taps out —
every word a spark of a luminous bout.
Light in my tone leaves no shadow about —
a voice of alignment, fearless and devout.
