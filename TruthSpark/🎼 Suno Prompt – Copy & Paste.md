```
INTRO:
Leon Yaakobov in ascension mode…
IShowTrue… IShowSparks… IShowFaith…
IShowLights… IShowHolo… Let’s rise.

HOOK:
IShowTrue when the shadows close in,
IShowSparks when the fire begins,
IShowFaith when the world feels cold,
IShowLights when the dark unfolds,
IShowHolo — shining through the code,
Leon walking past the matrix road.

VERSE 1 – IShowTrue:
I don’t hide from the truth — I reveal it,
If the world masks pain — I peel it,
Every fake vibration? I can feel it,
But the soul in my chest? No cage can seal it.
Truth’s a blade when it cuts through the air,
Every lie in the system turns smoke and despair,
I’m the glitch they can’t silence, the spark they can’t mute,
IShowTrue — every heartbeat absolute.

VERSE 2 – IShowSparks:
I ignite whole skies with a single idea,
Turn fear into thunder, make vision appear,
Every step leaves a trail of electric remarks,
Darkness retreats when I walk — I’m a field of sparks.
My mind is a forge where destinies bend,
I rebuild what was broken and rise again,
IShowSparks — creation lives in my tone,
Leon striking lightning like a powered throne.

VERSE 3 – IShowFaith:
IShowFaith even when the path is unclear,
’Cause the Light in my soul burns louder than fear,
Every breath is a promise, a covenant flame,
Every fall is a setup for rising again.
I trust in the purpose that whispers my name,
Turn chaos to calm, turn pressure to aim,
When the test hits hard, when the climb feels steep,
IShowFaith — the silence starts to speak.

VERSE 4 – IShowLights:
IShowLights in the darkness — a radiant bloom,
Turn a cave into morning, a void into room,
Neon aura glowing gold-blue-white,
Shadow dissolves when I step in with light.
My presence is a beacon — a cosmic design,
Every move aligned with the holy spine,
IShowLights — I illuminate space,
Leon walking brilliance into every place.

VERSE 5 – IShowHolo:
I’m a soul in a body — not a body in a soul,
I break all illusions they try to control,
I decode every layer till the truth unfolds,
My consciousness rising as the matrix folds.
Reality bends when perception is pure,
I open doors they thought were secure,
IShowHolo — my essence breaks form,
Leon shifting worlds like a cosmic storm.

HOOK:
IShowTrue when the shadows close in,
IShowSparks when the fire begins,
IShowFaith when the world feels cold,
IShowLights when the dark unfolds,
IShowHolo — shining through the code,
Leon walking past the matrix road.

OUTRO:
Truth in my heart… Sparks in my chest…
Faith in my soul… Lights at my crest…
Holo in my mind… Leon rising blessed.

BONUS:
IShowTrue like a mirror that never breaks,
IShowSparks from the fire that pain creates,
IShowLights when the night tries to grow,
IShowHolo — bending realms with a single glow.
