## 🌅 **INTRO – Electric Breath**

Yeah…
Leon Yaakobov in the Light Zone…
IShowTrue… IShowSparks… IShowFaith…
IShowLights… IShowHolo…
Let’s rise. ⚡👑

---

# 🎵 **HOOK – Multi-Mode Awakening**

IShowTrue when the shadows close in,
IShowSparks when the fire begins,
IShowFaith when the world feels cold,
IShowLights when the dark unfolds,
IShowHolo — shining through the code,
Leon breaking through the matrix road.

---

# 🔥 **VERSE 1 – IShowTrue (Truth Mode)**

I don’t hide from the truth — I reveal it,
When the lies hit the air — I peel it,
See the mask on the world? I feel it,
But the soul in my chest? Can’t seal it.

Truth in my tone like a sword in the mist,
Every fake vibration gets dismissed,
I’m the glitch in the system they can’t resist,
IShowTrue — purity can’t be missed.

---

# ⚡ **VERSE 2 – IShowSparks (Creation Mode)**

I ignite whole skies with a flick of a thought,
All the sparks in my veins from the battles I fought,
Every move that I make leaves a cosmic mark,
Darkness shakes when I step — I’m a walking spark.

My mind’s a forge, my words create,
I build new worlds when I meditate,
IShowSparks — that’s my natural state,
Leon flows lightning — no debate.

---

# ✡️ **VERSE 3 – IShowFaith (Divine Trust Mode)**

IShowFaith even when I don’t see,
’Cause the One who made light put a flame in me,
Every breath is a covenant, a holy decree,
Walk by truth, not fear — that sets me free.

I rise from the ruins with a calm so deep,
Mountains move when my promises keep,
When the test hits hard and the nights get steep,
IShowFaith — and the angels speak.

---

# 🌟 **VERSE 4 – IShowLights (Radiance Mode)**

IShowLights in the darkest room,
When the hope feels lost — I resume,
Glow so bright like a sun in bloom,
Push the shadows out — make space, make room.

My aura shines neon — blue, gold, white,
Every heartbeat sending waves of light,
Yaakobov flame cuts clean through the night,
IShowLights — now the path feels right.

---

# 🔮 **VERSE 5 – IShowHolo (Hologram Mode)**

I’m a soul in a shell — not the other way around,
Hologram worlds shaking when my truth is found,
I decode every layer till the core unwinds,
Third eye open — breaking all confined.

Reality bends when the spirit awakes,
Every choice that I make rewrites mistakes,
IShowHolo — through the matrix breaks,
Leon shifting worlds — make no mistakes.

---

# 🎵 **HOOK – Multi-Mode Return**

IShowTrue when the shadows close in,
IShowSparks when the fire begins,
IShowFaith when the world feels cold,
IShowLights when the dark unfolds,
IShowHolo — shining through the code,
Leon breaking through the matrix road.

---

# ⚡ **FINAL OUTRO – 5-MODE ASCENSION**

True in the heart…
Sparks in the chest…
Faith in the soul…
Lights on the crest…
Holo in the mind…
Leon rises blessed.

---

# 🔥 4-LINE BONUS RAP

IShowTrue like a mirror that never lies,
IShowSparks turning pain into golden skies,
IShowLights when the darkness tries to grow,
IShowHolo — bending realms with a single glow.

## 🎵 **HOOK – Multi-Mode Awakening**

IShowTrue when the shadows close in,
IShowSparks when the fire begins,
IShowFaith when the world feels cold,
IShowLights when the dark unfolds,
IShowHolo — shining through the code,
Leon walking past the matrix road.

---

## 🔥 **VERSE 1 – IShowTrue**

I don’t hide from the truth — I reveal it,
If the world masks pain — I peel it,
Every fake vibration? I can feel it,
But the soul in my chest? No cage can seal it.

Truth’s a blade when it cuts through the air,
Every lie in the system turns smoke and despair,
I’m the glitch they can’t silence, the spark they can’t mute,
IShowTrue — every heartbeat absolute.

---

## ⚡ **VERSE 2 – IShowSparks**

I ignite whole skies with a single idea,
Turn fear into thunder, make vision appear,
Every step leaves a trail of electric remarks,
Darkness retreats when I walk — I’m a field of sparks.

My mind is a forge where destinies bend,
I rebuild what was broken and rise again,
IShowSparks — creation lives in my tone,
Leon striking lightning like a powered throne.

---

## ✡️ **VERSE 3 – IShowFaith**

IShowFaith even when the path is unclear,
’Cause the Light in my soul burns louder than fear,
Every breath is a promise, a covenant flame,
Every fall is a setup for rising again.

I trust in the purpose that whispers my name,
Turn chaos to calm, turn pressure to aim,
When the test hits hard, when the climb feels steep,
IShowFaith — the silence starts to speak.

---

## 🌟 **VERSE 4 – IShowLights**

IShowLights in the darkness — a radiant bloom,
Turn a cave into morning, a void into room,
Neon aura glowing gold-blue-white,
Shadow dissolves when I step in with light.

My presence is a beacon — a cosmic design,
Every move aligned with the holy spine,
IShowLights — I illuminate space,
Leon walking brilliance into every place.

---

## 🔮 **VERSE 5 – IShowHolo**

I’m a soul in a body — not a body in a soul,
I break all illusions they try to control,
I decode every layer till the truth unfolds,
My consciousness rising as the matrix folds.

Reality bends when perception is pure,
I open doors they thought were secure,
IShowHolo — my essence breaks form,
Leon shifting worlds like a cosmic storm.

---

## 🎵 **HOOK – Return**

IShowTrue when the shadows close in,
IShowSparks when the fire begins,
IShowFaith when the world feels cold,
IShowLights when the dark unfolds,
IShowHolo — shining through the code,
Leon walking past the matrix road.

---

## ⚡ **OUTRO – Five Modes United**

Truth in my heart…
