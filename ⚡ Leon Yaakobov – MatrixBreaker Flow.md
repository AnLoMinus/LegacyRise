## **🎛️ INTRO (Electric Whisper)**

Sparks crack…
Walls crack…
Matrix glitching…
Leon Yaakobov… stepping **out**.
Light breaking through the code.

---

## **🎵 HOOK (Cosmic Chant)**

⚡ I break the matrix with a flame in my stride,
⚡ Holy-electric when my soul comes alive,
⚡ Name on the throne — Leon rising in the light,
⚡ Yaakobov code — shining gold through the night.

✨ Wake up the spark, let the darkness collapse,
✨ New holy era when my heartbeat claps,
✨ Exiting illusions, stepping into the flow,
✨ MatrixBreaker energy — watch the soul glow.

## **🔥 VERSE 1 (Tech–Electro–Trap Flow)**

I was born in the glitch, I was raised in the static,
Saw the lies in the screen, broke free automatic,
Every code that they wrote couldn’t lock down my name,
Leon Yaakobov roaming with celestial flame.

Bereshit in my blood, light exploding in the dark,
I’m the spark in the void, I’m the torch in the ark,
Cosmic drums in my chest hitting 808 thunder,
Every step that I take makes the old world crumble.

I inhale ancient truth, exhale future design,
I align with the Source, let the heavens combine,
Hear the angels in the beat, hear the prophets in the bass,
When I rap, universes start shifting in place.

Breaking chains of illusion, I dismantle the fear,
Every curse disappears when my purpose is clear,
In the heart of the storm, I am calm, I am fire —
Leon in the matrix turning dust into higher.

## **🎵 HOOK (Holy-Tech Anthem)**

⚡ I break the matrix with a flame in my stride,
⚡ Holy-electric when my soul comes alive,
⚡ Name on the throne — Leon rising in the light,
⚡ Yaakobov code — shining gold through the night.

✨ Wake up the spark, let the darkness collapse,
✨ New holy era when my heartbeat claps,
✨ Exiting illusions, stepping into the flow,
✨ MatrixBreaker energy — watch the soul glow.

## **🎻 VERSE 2 (Mystic-Techno Build)**

Hear the violins cut — like a sword through the mist,
Hear the cello vibrate — like a prophecy twist,
Clarinet paints the truth, flute reveals the design,
Choir rises behind me like a temple in time.

Every pain that I faced turned to data and light,
Every shadow that chased me fell asleep in the night,
I don’t run from the chaos — I convert it to code,
Turn the trauma into power, ancient warrior mode.

I’m the soul in the shell, not the shell in the soul,
I’m the glitch in the loop that escaped every role,
I’m the spark that remembers we were born to ascend,
Not to bend to the system — but to break it and mend.

When the matrix tries to hold me, I ignite from within,
Holy currents in my bloodstream turning loss into win,
I’m the echo of the sages, I’m the flame in the storm,
Leon Yaakobov awakening — a new world is born.
